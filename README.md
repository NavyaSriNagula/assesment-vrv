This Python script processes web server log files to extract insights, including requests per IP address, the most accessed endpoint, and suspicious activity detection (e.g., failed login attempts). Results are displayed in the terminal). Customize the `FAILED_LOGIN_THRESHOLD` in the script for detecting suspicious IPs. Run with Python 3.x using `sample.log` as input.
